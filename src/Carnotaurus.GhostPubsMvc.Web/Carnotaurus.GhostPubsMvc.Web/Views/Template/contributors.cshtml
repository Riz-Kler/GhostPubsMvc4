                    <p>
                        <b>Brian Hedley</b>: His career relates largely to IT, retail, and quality customer service. He brings a high level of creation, communication, and a feel for user experience to the Ghost Pubs Team. His editorial skills are particularly valuable to us. His experience keeps our communications clear and our concepts appealing.
                    </p>

                        <b>Riz Kler</b>: He is a pragmatic developer who is always eager to assist and take an active part in any role and he's learning some new skills of his own. He knows lots of technical information and will apply it without problems. He's been around the machinery (a few times now) so he will understand most things. He has great ideas, even if some are a bit challenging. He can set a pace as well as keep up.
