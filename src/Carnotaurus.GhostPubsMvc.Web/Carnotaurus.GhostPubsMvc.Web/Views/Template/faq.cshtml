                    <p>
                        We can help you if your establishment is haunted or you wish to be included in tour by offering supernatural events.

                        Ghost Pubs is a fresh organization. We have already gained the respect of the paranormal community as well as those associated with the pub trade. We recently interviewed for a feature in The Publican’s Morning Advertiser. More than that, we are in contact with high calibre mediums, psychics, and the like. And more: we receive a high volume of web traffic.

                    <b>
                        Why, as publican, should you advertise that your pub is haunted?
                    </b>

                    <p>
                        There is a growing dark tourism. Being haunted is good for business. Tourists from all over the world want to stay at haunted establishments or at least include your pub in tour. We are aware of over 1300 haunted pubs: some open, some closed, and some no-longer standing. So, that's around 2.6% of all UK public houses and rising. So, some pubs thrive upon claiming a haunted presence.

                        How can running a haunted pub work for me?

                    <p>
                        This can work for you. At minimum, you could opt to be included in a regular Ghost Pubs ghost tour. This can bring more people to your pub. You may even be interested in hosting other paranormal events, such as, séances, psychic nights, tarot readings, and a ghost hunt. If you provide haunted accommodation then being haunted would work even better for you.

                    <p>
                        If you are interested then please contact Ghost Pubs to become involved.

                    <p>
                        In the unlikely event that we do not offer the specific paranormal service that you require ourselves, we would still endeavour to put you in contact with those who would fulfil your needs. (put further up), we are well stocked; one of our tour guides frighteningly resembles Bruce Campbell (Ash, the star of the classic Evil Dead film).

So, there is the advertising revenue. We may want to sell them more than just a directly listing. They might want a banner or similar. Also, we might want to charge them from going on a list of pubs that are interested in being a stopping point or starting point or end point on a haunted ghost pub tour. They might want a bespoke story, either provided by them or written by us to be placed on their directory listing. They may want us to source a paranormal service provider for an event to be hosted at the pub.
