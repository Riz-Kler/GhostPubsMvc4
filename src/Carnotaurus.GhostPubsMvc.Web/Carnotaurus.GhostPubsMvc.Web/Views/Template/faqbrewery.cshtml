                        We can help you if your establishment is supernaturally inhabited, you wish to be incorporated in a haunted hour, or you are
                        interested in providing a venue for paranormal events. We are officially recognised by the paranormal community and
                        those connected with pub houses. We, as of late, interviewed with The Publican's Morning Advertiser, the largest media outlet dedicated
                        to publicans. Here is the article that resulted from our interaction:

                        And that's only the tip of the iceberg: we get a high volume of web traffic. So, please see our contact details in the footer (below).

                                      Why, as publican, should you advertise that your pub is haunted?

                    <p>
                        There is a developing black tourist undercurrent. Being spooky is useful for business. Travelers from everywhere throughout the
                        world want to stay at haunted establishment or at a supernatural event at your public house. We are mindful that there are as many as
                        1500 haunted public houses. That's some 3% of all UK pubs. Many of these pubs flourish and your pub could too.

                    <p>
                        It can work for you! Being haunted can bring more people to your pub. Even if you're not haunted then you may even entertain
                        facilitating other paranormal occasions. For example, you could host: séances, psychic nights, tarot readings, or even a phantom chase.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is highly improbably. We most likely offer the particular paranormal service that you require.
                        If we cannot then we would attempt to place you in contact with the individuals who would satisfy your needs.

                        for a feature in The Publican’s Morning Advertiser. More than that, we are in contact with high calibre mediums, psychics, and the like.

                        Do you want to make more money from your establishment? Is your pub haunted? There is a growing dark tourism. So, read on!

                    <p>
                        Being haunted is good for business. Tourists from all over the world want to stay at these haunted
                        establishments or at least tour them.

                    <p>
                        We are aware of over 1500 haunted pubs: some open, some closed, and some no-longer standing.
                        So, that's around 3% of all UK public houses and rising.

                    <p>
                        We suspect that there are more. So, is your pub haunted?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some pubs thrive upon claiming a haunted presence.

                    <p>
                        At minimum, you could opt to be included in a regular Ghost Pubs ghost tour. This can bring more people to your pub.
                        You may even be interested in hosting other paranormal events, such as, séances, psychic nights, tarot readings, and a ghost hunt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you provide haunted accommodation then being haunted would work even better for you.

                        If you are interested then please contact Ghost Pubs to become involved. Even if we do not offer the specific

                        Nonetheless, we are well stocked; one of our tour guides frighteningly resembles Bruce Campbell (Ash, the star of the classic Evil Dead film).

                        We sell them our services when they contact us, we attempt to see them an annual registration to the Ghost Pubs website
                        (and one for myPUBGUIDE). So, there is the advertising revenue. We may want to sell them more than just a directly listing.
                        They might want a banner or similar. Also, we might want to charge them from going on a list of pubs that are interested in being a
                        stopping point or starting point or end point on a haunted ghost pub tour. They might want a bespoke story, either provided by them or
                        written by us to be placed on their directory listing. They may want us to source a paranormal service provider for an event
                        to be hosted at the pub.
